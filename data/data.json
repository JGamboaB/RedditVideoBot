I didn't have a rain tarp yet, leaving myself completely uncovered save for a sleeping bag.\n\nNow this was a trip from a summer camp in the area, so there were about six other teens with me. One kid decided \"hey, chocolate, that's not a smellable right?\" and left the chocolate in his pack, right next to mine, under the hammock. You may see where this is going.\n\nLo and behold, around 12:00, a juvenile black bear mosies his way on into our campsite looking for that sweet sweet chocolate. As he was messing with the packs underneath the hammock, his back kept bumping into me. I was starting to wake up but I was very groggy. I kinda thought it was the kid looking for something in his pack.\n\nThe bear realizes that the hammock is moving, and gives it a bat with his paw. like a cat with yarn. Swinging me.\n\nAt this point I realize this is not a camper, and start screaming. The rest of the campsite woke up and we threw rocks at the bear until it ran away. The kid got a severe punishment.\n\nedit: spelling",

Woke up my friend silently and made him listen too, we were freaking out.\n\nFinally they went away, so I slowly opened my tent zipper to look around and see who/what it was.\n\nThrew out a glowstick, and saw some eyes flash in the darkness\n\n\nTurns out it was 2 white desert foxes, whose footsteps were somehow extremely heavy sounding.

A snake had made its way under my tent and I think it was trying to get warm as it stopped moving right under where my back was.  After me moving a bit it finally went on its merry way. I'll never forget how it felt moving underneath me.",

It had been raining most of the night, but nothing \"scary\". \n We were halted in a small clearing, surrounded by those giant-ass pine trees Georgia has everywhere.  All of a sudden. the wind started picking up, and strobe lightning was popping all around us.\n\nYou know those [wiggly guys](https://i.imgur.com/YKw9tlD.mp4)?  Well, the pine trees started doing shit like that.  I have never felt so small and completely at the will of nature as that night, and I've done solo open ocean sailing.\n\nThe next morning, they confirmed what we already know - we were danger-close to an F2 tornado.  There was one injury on another squad in our platoon, but otherwise the rest of us were unscathed.",

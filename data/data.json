A snake had made its way under my tent and I think it was trying to get warm as it stopped moving right under where my back was.  After me moving a bit it finally went on its merry way. I'll never forget how it felt moving underneath me.",

It\u2019s late at night, the embers of the fire are dying down, we\u2019re about to go to sleep, when we hear what I can only describe as a bone-chilling moan in the woods.\n\nWe looked at each other & decided it was trees rubbing together, but then it happened 2 more times.  My dad grabbed the flashlight & I walked behind him with a big stick, determined I would save him if something went wrong.\n\nEventually we discover a woman lying on the ground, not far from our campsite.  She was on a hill, with her head facing down, feet uphill, continuing to moan.\n\nTurns out she had so much to drink that she could hardly talk, but she was also camping out in these woods with her boyfriend.  They had a big fight & he drove away, leaving her alone in the forest.  She had seen our fire dying & wanted to give us the rest of her firewood before she left too, but had tripped & was too drunk to get up. We got her back to her campsite, & made sure she wasn\u2019t driving anywhere that night.  I\u2019ll never forget that moaning sound though.",

Guess they were disappointed in what they found and luckily not desperately hungry.  Anyways, I was very scared and tried to remain completely still and silent during this brief encounter.",

Went out hiking  the morning of the second day and pretty soon found ourselves off trail on a pretty steep incline along the Monashee River. We were about 100 ft up the incline. Suddenly one of my friends lost his footing and started to slide. One the way down he took out my other friend and I watched them hit every rock and tree on the way down to the rapids. \n\nI climbed down to find my one friend dead on the side of the river, and the other taken away by the river. His body was found 2 weeks later 2 km from where they fell in. His body, or whatever is left of it, is still in the river because when Search and Rescue tried to remove it from the log jam it was stuck in, the boulders on the river bank came loose and collapsed on top of his corpse. \n\nThis was a very abbreviated version of the story, but overall a very scary day.",

I hadn't been assigned a vehicle yet so I just monkey'd up a tree and waited while they tore into our rations, wrecked our tent, and then fucked off.

We made dinner and were having a a good time in the evening when some guy passed by our site in the river. He had a fishing pole, so we were like whatever. He asked to go through our site to the road and we figured it was harmless enough and said yeah. \n\nHe stopped and looked around our site and started asking us questions. How old are you? Where are you from? How long are you staying. Typical questions that were none of his business but we were naive enough to answer. He eventually leaves and heads down the canyon on the road.\n\nA couple hours later, he shows back up with a buddy. Both of these guys are middle aged, probably mid 40s. They start asking more questions. The original guy walks around and snoops about our campsite. We got an uneasy feeling and were super grateful when they eventually left. But they went up the canyon, rather than back where they came from. \n\nAnother couple hours pass and it's dark. My friend mentions how she can't hear anything because of the river and it had her a bit antsy. We talked and it turned out we had both been on edge since the guys left. We had never seen them go back down the canyon. \n\nWe both had a gut feeling that we needed to leave and FAST. Maybe nothing would have happened, but we both felt it. They guys asked all the right questions to know that we would be there alone and defenseless that night.",

It had been raining most of the night, but nothing \"scary\". \n We were halted in a small clearing, surrounded by those giant-ass pine trees Georgia has everywhere.  All of a sudden. the wind started picking up, and strobe lightning was popping all around us.\n\nYou know those [wiggly guys](https://i.imgur.com/YKw9tlD.mp4)?  Well, the pine trees started doing shit like that.  I have never felt so small and completely at the will of nature as that night, and I've done solo open ocean sailing.\n\nThe next morning, they confirmed what we already know - we were danger-close to an F2 tornado.

He told me it's a common issue and that there is help. 1.5 years of tapering off and two surgeries later I used bad nosespray for the final time. I could kick myself for not talking about it for more than twenty years.\n\nEdit: I am working my way through the comments and questions, I posted it before going to bed and didn't expect much reaction, so:\n\nThe addiction's name is Rhinitis medicamentosa. So it's not an addiction like alcohol (in the way there's a \"reward\" system in your brain), but it's a self sustaining process - you have an infection and take nose spray. If you do it more than a few days the reason why you took it at first is gone, but these sprays mean the nose clogs again. So you take nose spray against nose spray, which got worse and worse over the years.\n\nMany asked which spray I took: I largely gave up talking about any names in this regard - by definition of stereotype every redditor except me is from the US, so your stuff has different names in the store than the German stuff I took. \n\nThe nose spray I used is sold in Germany as Nasic which has xylometazoline as main active agent.\n\nSome others asked about the surgeries, so here is more about the process: \nMy new family doctor sent me to an ENT for help. He mentioned that next to the effect of the addiction, there's often a background to it. Turned out my concha were enlarged and my septum deviated. I must have broken my nose once, the ENT insisted ot must have happened although I didn't know it. Maybe when I fell off my bike as toddler or so. Both limited how much air could pass and made it even more prone to clogging, which was boosted by the misuse of Nasic. \n\nThe concha were cauterized (so a small intervention, about 30 minutes + a few days sick leave), the septum deviation was corrected via full anaesthesia surgery in the hospital by the ENT + 2 weeks sick leave\n\nThe process took so long as the ENT started with tapering off by flooding the nose spray with hayfever and sea salt ones, (effect: Reducing bad nose spray from 5x a day to 1-2x), then cauterizing after which the nose needed to heal (reducing it to 0-1x per day) before the surgery. As the septum deviation is done in hospital I needed to wait a few weeks until I could do it, and afterwards the nose needs some weeks to heal again.",

If I couldn't get a good grade, I didn't like the class. Heck, I wouldn't even start a book if I thought it might be too hard or too long and I might not finish it.\n\nThen I realized the purpose of classes (and books and other things) was to learn and that hard ones were likely the ones I learned the most from, even if I didn't get the best grade.\n\nI started doing all sorts of stuff with the idea that I just wanted the experience. Even if I was the worst one out there, who cares? I wasn't there for the achievement, I wanted to learn things.\n\nThis works socially as well and I started taking way more risks, telling myself that, at the very least, it would be a learning experience.\n\nI saw a saying once: \"It's only a failure if you stop trying, otherwise, it's an experiment.\" I love it.",

Here's some suggestions with the reminder that this works for me, may not work for you. If you REALLY are serious about losing weight, consult a doctor and/or nutritionist.\n\n1) I was a carb fiend. Pasta, rice, bread, if it had a carb, I wanted fourth servings of it. Sugar is a carb too. So I started watching how many carbs I consumed a day. It shocked me. So now I'm a lot more aware of how many carbs I eat. \n\n2) Building on number 1, serving sizes. To me, an open container of any size was a single serving. I pay attention to how much I'm supposed to eat. For snacks, I'm addicted to SmartFood. You can order a bunch of them in single serving sizes. \n\n3) Vegetables. I always ate veggies, now I eat more. What used to be two thirds potatoes or pasta or rice with a meal is now two thirds vegetables.\n\n4) Cut back on meat. We usually go meatless for dinner at least twice a week. I hardly eat it at breakfast and lunch is about 50/50. I'd say 90% of the meat we do eat is chicken or fish. \n\n5) I have always LOVED to cook but now I'm really stretching my wings and trying things I wouldn't do before. If you don't know how to cook, LEARN. Alton Brown or Ina Garten are great starting places. Don't be intimidated by it, you're not working for Gordon Ramsay, you're just feeding yourself. Learn spices. Steaming veggies sucks. Roast that shit. Stir fry that shit. Eat it raw. Anything but steaming. Except boiling, that's worse. \n\n6) Bring your lunch to work. If you eat breakfast at work, bring that too. Same with snacks unless you can get healthy ones there. \n\n7) Don't beat yourself up if you have a cheeseburger. You ARE going to fail. I fail all the time. Every day is a new start. \n\n8) We only eat out or order out once a week. \n\n9) Water. More than you think. Learn to love to pee. \n\n10) I can't do this right now because I broke my foot but a walk after every meal helps with your blood sugar. Ten minutes after breakfast and lunch, a half hour after dinner.\n\n11) All things in moderation. You can have butter or cheese or fried foods, just not every meal. And keep to what you're supposed to eat, it's a lot smaller than you think.\n\nAnyway, that's some of the stuff that *I* personally did. It worked for me, it may not work for you. I'm not a dietician, just a dude who wanted to lose some weight.",

Basically she was posing nude for drawing classes and making sweet sweet love to her favorite introverted art students every year.  This went on for a decade that I know of.  When she was 63 she married a 21 year old former student.",

The day of the party arrives, and she has her husband hang the pinata in a tree and the kids go after it, blindfolded, with baseball bats, etc. \n\nThey fucking destroy the thing, and are very disappointed when...nothing comes out. My wife had not put the candy inside, thinking the pinata comes already filled. \n\nShe still gets teased about this; our daughter is now 44. \n\n\"Riiiiight mom,\" goes the saying. \"It was filled with *magical* Mexican candy...\"",

We didn't typically allow pinatas because our party area was outside, and we didn't want any remanents of confetti or candy wrappers to blow into our pools. \n\nWe decided to make an exception because it was a particularly wind-less day, and the birthday child was really excited to have a pinata. We kept the pinata stored inside, so that any candy wouldn't be too melted in the sun. When the party started, we hung it up on a tree branch for the kids.\n\nWell, it turns out that he was excited, not for candy, but to see the look on his peers' faces when SPINACH came out of the pinata. Not bagged spinach btw - several bags worth of instantly cooked from the sun, wilted spinach, that began to instantly stick to and stain the concrete once it fell to the ground.\n\nObviously, the children didn't rush to pick the spinach up, so I had to scrape spinach off of the concrete before the next birthday party.",
